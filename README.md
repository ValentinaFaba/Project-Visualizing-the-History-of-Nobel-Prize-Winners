# Project-Visualizing-the-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners
The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.

I analyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:


-What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?


-Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?


-Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?


-Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?


-Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
